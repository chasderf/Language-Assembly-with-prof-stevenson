A macro is a small piece of defined code that can be called over and over again like a procedure.
The difference is that a macro does code substitution.
This means that any time the macro is called the code that was written gets placed in line.
This means that your code will grow the more times you use it
For this reason you should write macros that don’t contain a great deal of code

Macros are typically placed in global scope(outside of any procedure and at the top of the file) or
inside an include file that gets included into your code

Let’s take a look at a macro that was created for asmlib to make life easier

Endl MACRO
Call NewLine
ENDM

This is a very simple macro that calls the new line procedure that is part of the asmlib library
A macro then has this syntax
