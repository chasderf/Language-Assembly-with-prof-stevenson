Parameters

You can also pass parameters to a macro using the following syntax

Name MACRO arg-1, arg-2. . . .
;macro body

ENDM

When passing parameters to a macro it is important to know that you cannot use immediate values.
You can use a register or a variable.
The following is a macro that shows how to squealed a value and return the square in the eax:

INCLUDE asmlib.inc

MySquare MACRO Val

mov eax, Val
MUL val
ENDM

.data
val DWORD 5

.code

Main PROC
mySquare val
call writeInt
endl

exit
Main ENDP
END main

This MySquare macro only has one argument. If you write macros that have more than one
argument you simply need to place a comma between them

REQUIRED PARAMETERS

If you want to insure that a parameter is passed to a macro you can use the REQ qualifier following
the parameter statement. This tells the assemblyer that a parameter must be supplied. If it is not
that an error will be thrown. Here is MySquare macro again but with a require parameter

INCLUDE asmlib.inc

MySquare MACRO Val : REQ
mov eax, Val
MUL val
ENDM

.data
val DWORD 5

.code

Main PROC
mySquare val
call writeInt
endl

exit
Main ENDP
END main
