The local directive

The local directive is supplied by masm to make the creation of local variables easy. You simply give
the variable a name and specify the type of data the variable will hold. The local directive also
serves as a substitute for the enter instruction and has the following syntax::

SumThree PROC
LOCAL sumVar : DWORD

Ret
SumThree ENDP

Notice that the prologue is no longer needed and there is no need to leave the statement. The local
directive supplies all of this for you. You can have more than one local variable,
they simply need to be separated by a comma

MyProc PROC
LOCAL val1 : DWORD, val2 BYTE

ret
MyProc ENDP
