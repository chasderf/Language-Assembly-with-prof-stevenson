Array of structures

You can create an array of structures the same way

You can use any other data type. A struct is a data type that you have defined. You can declare an
array fo struct s by comma separating the values

Person STRUCT
First BYTE 16 DUP(0) ;member variables
Last BYTE 16 DUP(0)

Person ENDS

.data

people Person <“joe “, “smith”>, <“Glenn”, “Stevenson”>, <“Jane”,doe”>
.code

You can also print out an array of struct s using either indirect or direct addressing. The following
prints the above array using direct addressing:

INCLUDE asmlib.inc

Person STRUCT
First BYTE 16 DUP(0)
Last BYET 16 DUP(0)
Person ENDS

.data
people Person <“joe “, “smith”>, <“Glenn”, “Stevenson”>, <“Jane”,doe”>
.code
Main proc

Mov ECX,3
Mov EDI,0
L2:
Lea edx, people [edi].first ;load the address of the first name

Call writeLine
Lea edx, people[edi].last ;edi holds offset
Call writeLine
Endl

Add edi, TYPE person ;increment by the size of a person struct

LOOP L2

Exit
Main ENDP
END main
