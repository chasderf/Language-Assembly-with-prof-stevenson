What are you really doing when you write a piece of software? The answer is that you are solving
some sort of problem. The easiest way to tackle the problem is to break the large problem into
several smaller problems and then tackle the smaller problems one at a time. In computer science
we have this thing called a stepwise refinement.

After you have written a procedure and would like to use it, all you have to do is “call” it

First some procedures need to be supplied additional information before they can be used.
Other types of procedures don’t need any information, before they can be used. They’ll just supply
information back to you

Some procedures do both, they need information to process and return some kind of value back to
you.
Finally you should known that the most simple procedure doesn’t take any additional inforamation
and it doesn’t produce any value

A procedure is a self contained entity that acts almost like a program within a program

Name PROC

; procedure body

Ret ;return from procedure
Name ENDP

The ret statement tells the code to branch back to where it came from

The END main directives. All assembly files have to have the END directive to mark the end of the
code
