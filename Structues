In an earlier unit we looked at arrays which was our first look into creating our own data types. As
we saw an array is homogenous type but it is still an abstract data type that the programmer
declares

Primitive types BYTE, WORD, DWORD, etc. are built into the language at and defined by you at
the .code info

You can use any of these types and combine them to create a structure.
Unlike arrays members of structures are not homogenous. This means that you can mix as many
types as you need to create a structure. You can also have an array of structures that you define

Point STRUCT
X DWORD ?
Y DWORD ?
Point ENDS

A structure is defined by giving the struct a name that you create followed by the struct keyword.

The variables within the body of the structure are called member variables and you can put any valid
x86 assembly data type within the body of the structure. You can even put another struct there
